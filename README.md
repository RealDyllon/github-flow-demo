# github-flow-demo

This repo is a rough, unpolished demonstration of [github flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow).

Refer to the [actions tab](https://github.com/RealDyllon/github-flow-demo/actions), and the 
[deployments/environments view](https://github.com/RealDyllon/github-flow-demo/deployments) to see:

1. Automatic deployments to the staging env
2. Approval-required deployments to the production env

This avoids the need for "release" or "prod" branches. 

Deployment approvals may be audited in the deployments page. Deployment approval criteria may be changed in settings -> environments -> <env_name>
